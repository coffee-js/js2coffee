# Try out Js2coffee in the browser
[js2coffee.org](http://js2coffee.org)  

You can swtich the mode (JS -> Coffee and Coffee -> JS) at the top in the center.

The new online editor has some improvements:

- Line Numbers
- Syntax Check for JavaScript and CoffeeScript
- Token Tooltips
- Execution of the JavaScript source

The website uses the [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/) editor, which has some
[known issues for mobile/touch devices](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues?labels=mobile&page=1&state=open):

- scrolling don't work for touch devices
- iOS devices should use the [iframe](http://rstacruz.github.io/js2coffee/editor.html) when using write mode
