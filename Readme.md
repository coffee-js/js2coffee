# Try out Js2coffee in the browser

## js2coffee.org
Currently the repository [github.com/rstacruz/js2coffee.org](https://github.com/rstacruz/js2coffee.org) and its website are not in sync with the master branch and the npm registry of this repository [github.com/rstacruz/js2coffee](https://github.com/rstacruz/js2coffee). The website js2coffee.org uses an old version of Js2coffee. This will be fixed soon.

## Latest version

You can preview the latest Js2coffee version on this site:
[rstacruz.github.io/js2coffee](http://rstacruz.github.io/js2coffee)

The new online editor has some improvements:

- Line Numbers
- Syntax Check for JavaScript and CoffeeScript
- Token Tooltips
- Execution of the JavaScript source

The website uses the [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/) editor, which has some
[known issues for mobile/touch devices](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues?labels=mobile&page=1&state=open):

- scrolling don't work for touch devices
- iOS devices should use the [iframe](http://rstacruz.github.io/js2coffee/editor.html) when using write mode
